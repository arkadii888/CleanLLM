CleanLLM combines the privacy of local models with the power of remote APIs. We stripped away the visual noise often found in modern tools, retaining only the essential functionality to let you focus on what matters.

### Key Features

* **Hybrid Workflow:** Seamlessly switch between local models and cloud providers.
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Native support for the standard, enabling deep integration with your data and tools.
* **Smart UX:** All professional settings are accessible in a single click but remain hidden by default to keep your workspace clutter-free.

**Built with React & Electron.**
